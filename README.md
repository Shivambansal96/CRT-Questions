## FAQ

**Q: Why can't I open the HTML file directly?**
A: Browsers block `fetch` requests to local files. Use a local server as described in Getting Started.

**Q: How is my progress saved?**
A: Progress is stored in your browser's localStorage under the key `completedQuestions`.

**Q: Can I add my own questions?**
A: Yes! Edit `questions.json` to add, modify, or remove CRT interview questions.

**Q: Is this mobile-friendly?**
A: Absolutely! The design is responsive and optimized for all device sizes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Questions not loading**: Ensure you're running a local server
- **Avatar not showing**: Check that `assets/Creator.png` exists
- **Progress not saving**: Verify localStorage is enabled in your browser

### Performance Tips
- Keep `questions.json` reasonably sized
- Use compressed images for avatars
- Consider pagination for large question sets
